(See http://danlucraft.com/blog/2011/02/coding-dojo-version-control-system/ for a description of this problem)

This branch contains the original RVC program I wrote to create the .rvc repository that is in the master branch.

That repository contains the history of commits of this project. (This .git repository only contains 3 branches with the problem and solutions.)
